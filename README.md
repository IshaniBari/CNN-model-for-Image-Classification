# CNN-model-for-Image-Classification
Built and trained a CNN model which would classify and recognize faces after training it on training dataset. For this purpose, used the concept of multiclass classification using neural networks. 

For the dataset, I used the kaggle dataset-‘The Bollywood celebs dataset’ .The Bollywood celebs dataset consists of faces of 100 Bollywood celebrities and about 180 images of each celebrity. Out of the 100 celebrities, I took only 3 celebs images- Alia Bhatt, Deepika Padukone and Anushka Sharma (140 images of each) for training the CNN model and stored them in different folders corresponding to their names. For validation purpose I used about 30 images of each of the 3 celebs and for testing purpose I used 2 images of each of the 3 celebs.

The aim of my model was to classify and recognize each of the three celebrities after training the model on their images.
